The short answer is "YES" Instant Noodles are very bad for your health. But it is important to know why, so that you are fully informed.

## Instant Noodles: Health Implications

Instant noodles have become a popular option for cooking in our everyday lives. We always look for easy methods to cook food so that we save time. This has resulted in the entry of instant noodles into our kitchen.

## What are instant noodles?

Instant noodles are cereal based products that have been pre-cooked and it is sold in small portions packed in the form of dried noodles that come in packets, cups and bowls. 

The product is easy to prepare and all you need to do is to boil water and add the packet contents along with tastemaker powders and it is ready to eat in just two minutes.
 There are other types of instant noodles there all you need to add is hot water and cover it for sometime. Voila, An instant meal is ready.

## Ingredients of instant noodles

The basic ingredients of instant noodles are 
1. Refined flour or wheat flour known as maida, 
2. Palm oil, sugar, salt 
3. Preservatives such as MSG or monosodium glutamate also called ajinomoto.

## Why is it bad for health?

### 1. Refined flours

The basic ingredient of instant noodles is refined flour which is said to be processed and very low on nutrients. Refined flours are said to have an high glycemic index, which can increase blood sugars and cause [insulin insensitivity](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance). 

High intake of refined carbohydrates such as maida or refined wheat flour, refined rice flour and corn can increase the risk of weight gain, heart diseases and diabetes.

They have introduced whole grain and multigrain noodles, but nutritionally it remains the same as noodles made from refined flour with minimal differences.

### 2. Weight gain

Instant noodles are high in calories and each serving of instant noodles gives about 300-400 kcal. Frequent intake of these noodles along with a high calorie diet and less physical activity can cause weight gain. 

Eating instant noodles frequently has been linked to higher triglyceride levels, higher blood sugar, particularly fasting levels and high blood pressure, which is collectively called [metabolic syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10783-metabolic-syndrome).

### 3. High sodium content

They are high in sodium containing preservatives such as [Mono Sodium Glutamate(MSG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate) or ajinomoto. MSG is said to be safe in low doses and is considered as Generally Recognised As Safe(GRAS) by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Association (EFSA). 

Only studies on rats have shown its adverse effects on heart, liver and nerve toxicity, fetal development, infertility etc and will need further studies in humans. Nevertheless, it is always better to exercise caution on MSG consumption.

Any meat or vegetables added to instant noodles are dehydrated and are again rich in sodium. They also contain preservatives which are essentially sodium compounds.

### 4. Nutritionally poor

Instant noodles lack many essential nutrients such as protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. So they only provide energy and some fats. 

The product has been marketed to be "healthy" by the food companies, by showing vegetables on the packaging, misleading us into thinking it is healthy. Well, it is an instant food, meeting our instant needs, not our nutritional needs.

### 5. Loaded with unhealthy fats

Most instant noodles contain hydrogenated fats known as trans fats which are harmful for your heart health. The combination of unhealthy fats and sodium can be bad for blood pressure.

### 6. Contaminant risk

Instant noodles may contain contaminants more than the permitted levels such as lead, nickel, chromium, aluminium which are harmful to various organs such as kidney, heart, liver, affect our nervous and immune systems and cause DNA damage.

[Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-03/documents/pahs_factsheet_cdc_2013.pdf) have also been detected in instant noodles and have been associated with cancers. This may happen during various manufacturing processes such as cooking, processing, packaging and transportation.

Another common contaminant is [Biphenol-A (BPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A) which is used in manufacturing plastic materials. It is most commonly found in plastic containers used for packaging instant noodles. 

These can be leached into the food on exposure to heat and is said to be a hormone disruptor. It gets deposited in our fat layers and can accumulate in our body. [Adiponectin](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22439-adiponectin), a hormone responsible for managing obesity and blood sugars, can be disrupted by the presence of BPA.

## Take away

- If you do love instant noodles, you can improve its nutritional value by adding vegetables, protein such as paneer(cottage cheese), tofu, fish or chicken, sprouts and dals, seeds such as flaxseed, sesame seeds and nuts.
- You can reduce the amount of taste maker added to instant noodles to reduce sodium content or completely avoid and add your own homemade seasonings.
- Fortification of instant noodles may help to bridge this gap, so the instant noodle manufacturers should keep this in mind and introduce new, reformulated and safer products. It is necessary to manufacture low sodium products.
- Those who consume noodles should also follow a balanced diet to bridge the nutritional gap.
- There is a dire need for long term testing for contaminants and additives in instant noodles.

You can refer to one of my case files - [Maggi Noodles and Acute Pancreatitis](https://sanjanashenoy.in/case-files/maggi-noodles-pancreatitis-case) where a patient was addicted to instant noodles and suffered from Stomach Infection and pancreatitis.
