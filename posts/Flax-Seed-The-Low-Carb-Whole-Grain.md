Flax Seeds may be tiny, but they are mighty. They carry one of the biggest nutrient payloads on the planet. And while it's not technically a grain, it has a similar vitamin and mineral profile to grains, while the amount of fiber, antioxidants, and Omega-3 fatty acids in flax is not available in grains.

## Benefits of Flax Seeds:

- They are high in most of the B vitamins, magnesium, and manganese Flax seed is Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are a key force against inflammation in our bodies. Mounting evidence shows that inflammation plays a part in many chronic diseases including heart disease, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and even some cancers.

- Because they are high in soluble fiber, ground flax seeds can help ease the passage of stools and thus relieve constipation, hemorrhoids and diverticular disease.

- Fiber in the diet also helps stabilize blood sugar, and, of course, promotes proper functioning of the intestines.

## Phytochemicals: 

**Flax seed is high in phytochemicals,  including many antioxidants** It is perhaps our best source of lignans(phytoestrogens-hormones like substances), which convert in our intestines to substances which tend to balance female hormones. There is evidence that lignans may promote fertility, reduce peri-menopausal symptoms, and possibly help reduce cancer risk. 

- The lignans in flaxseed appear to play a role in protecting against breast, colon, prostate, and perhaps skin cancer. In addition, lignans may help prevent Type 2 diabetes.  There are a few things one needs to bear in mind while using flax seeds . (Flax oil, as such, is not easily available in India).

- Avoid eating flax seeds whole. They have the nasty habit of leaving your body in the same condition they came in.Its best to lightly roast the seeds, either in a kadhai till they start crackling (similar to til or sesame seeds). Raw Flax seeds, contain a substance called cyanate, which can be harmful to the body in larger quantities.

- Ideally , one should grind the roasted flax seeds, This is easily done in a grinder. The recommended amount per day, is about 1-2 tablespoons.
