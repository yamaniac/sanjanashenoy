## Introduction
This is one of the most interesting case files I have come across. It has become fashionable to eat instant noodles, and hence there has been a rise in cases of stomach infection and pancreatitis. Let me share this experience with you.

## Case Presentation
I got a call this morning for a referral for a gastroenterology case, and when I went to see the patient, I was a little taken aback to see a boy barely 18 years old.

I read the file, and the patient had been diagnosed with **acute pancreatitis**. The boy was very lean; in fact, he was underweight. So I started taking down his food habits.

## Dietary Assessment
Sadly, the boy had no proper food habits or timings whatsoever:
- He was starving all the time and missed a lot of meals
- He was not drinking a drop of water in a day

The parents were not ready to disclose his drinking and smoking habits, but little did they know that I knew about it as it was mentioned in the file. The boy was drinking alcohol daily.

The boy had a very high intake of fat and sugar, chugging down only Coke instead of water. 

## Clinical Presentation
Medically, his symptoms were:
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Sudden weight loss
- Bloating
- Stomach cramps

## Management
First, I had to tell the patient to stop his intake of junk food, oily snacks, and Coke. When I was explaining his diet to him, he happened to mention that he was addicted to Maggi instant noodles and was having them regularly for dinner.

Now I could deduce that his problem was from eating instant noodles. The noodles have a harmful waxy coating which can cause a lot of digestive problems and do not form part of a balanced diet, nor do they provide any valuable nutrients.

### Dietary Intervention
He was prescribed a diet with a very high caloric load. A high-carbohydrate, high-protein, and low-fat diet was prescribed. He was supposed to eat every 2 hours starting from 7 a.m. in the morning. Simple carbohydrates such as juices and glucose water were provided in every alternate meal.

Every meal had to have some protein to prevent weight loss and help gain some muscle. Low fat was provided from MCT oils, which are easily absorbed in the body, and the best example is coconut oil. 

#### Food Replacements

| Eliminated    | Replaced With         |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Egg yolks    | Egg whites            |
| Fried meats  | Lean well-cooked meats|
| Potato chips | Boiled potatoes       |
| Coke         | Skimmed milk          |

Fermented milk products like low-fat yogurt were used to replenish the gut-friendly bacteria. 

### Additional Interventions
He was mainly asked to chew very slowly and was also referred to a psychiatrist for learning relaxation techniques and counseling.

His family was encouraged to give him a calm environment and to allow him to heal both physically and mentally.

## Outcome
There was a considerable difference in his energy levels; he has been better than ever and has also realized the toll his body had taken due to unhealthy eating habits.

## Conclusion
It would be very important for him to stick to a healthy diet as many of these cases are prone to diabetes due to the strain on the pancreas, which is the main organ for blood sugar metabolism. Encourage healthy eating habits from a younger age and reap the benefits later.
