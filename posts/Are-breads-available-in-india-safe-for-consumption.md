There has been an ongoing debate on the safety of bread consumption in India. With the increasing demand for bread, a lot of multinational companies have started mass producing bread. With the rising use of additives and preservatives in bread, testing has revealed that many bread samples in metropolitan cities have been tested positive for banned additives. 

**"So the question arises if the bread produced in India is actually safe for our consumption?"**


## History of Bread

The art of bread making can be traced through prehistoric times from the beginning of agriculture. All countries have their own types of bread, and it is a staple food in every continent.

The composition of bread was much simpler and healthier in earlier times, as it was made from whole wheat and other whole grains where the grain would be ground along with its fiber and germ area. The wheat grain basically has three main parts:
- The **bran** which provides fiber
- The **endosperm** - starch or sugar
- The **germ** - protein, Vitamin E, folate (folic acid), phosphorus, thiamine, zinc, and magnesium as well as essential fatty acids and fatty alcohols, making bread a powerhouse of nutrients

The basic ingredients of bread are wheat flour (whole or refined), yeast, fat, sugar, and salt, while some countries add egg and milk to add more flavor and nutrition. Traditionally made bread from whole wheat flour is healthier as it contains the bran and germ parts, making it richer in fiber and nutrients and preventing sugar level spikes. The fiber content makes us feel fuller and hence controls the quantity we consume. Fiber can reduce the risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and obesity.

Over time, particularly once the bread-making process started to advance in European countries, the demand for white bread increased after the invention of the milling and refining process. The fiber and wheat germ would be removed, giving way to the white bread concept we still consume today. There was a notion that eating white bread was more appealing, making people feel more aristocratic. Most importantly, it increased the shelf life of bread and reduced spoilage time. Therefore, the demand for white bread increased substantially.

## Bread in India

Colonization was the main reason for the introduction of bread in India. Indians were new to the concept of bread as they did not have ovens. Bread was introduced by the Portuguese as "Pao or Pav," and with the British, the loaf of bread became a staple part of the Indian diet. Bread was still made with whole wheat flour at that time. But during Mughal rule, refined wheat flour or maida was introduced to India from Middle Eastern countries as the Mughals did not like our whole wheat flatbreads. Even then, the refining process was not as fine as the maida product available now.

Indians adapted bread as part of Indian cuisine once the concept of convenience foods started to spread in India.

Today, bread is a part of every Indian household and is consumed as a snack or a meal.

## Types of Bread in the Indian Market and Their Nutritional Facts

### White Bread

The most commonly sold "white bread" is consumed in the form of bread loaves, burger buns, pav, hot dog buns, rolls, and wraps, so all the junk food we consume is actually making us eat a lot of refined wheat flour. It lacks B vitamins, fiber, vitamin E and has a high [glycemic index](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/glycemic-index-good-versus-bad-carbs).

White bread made of refined flour has a longer shelf life and tastes better than whole wheat bread. Overconsumption of white bread is the reason for various diseases:

- **[Diabetes mellitus](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/7104-diabetes)** : Refined wheat flour has a high Glycemic Index and can cause spikes in sugar levels.
- **Weight gain**: The spikes in blood sugar can cause insulin surges, causing belly fat and weight gain.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: The refining process of wheat flour strips off the B vitamins and Vitamin E, resulting in deficiencies.
- **Constipation**: Lack of fiber causes digestive issues such as bloating, irregular bowel movements, and [irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/).

### How Can a Manufacturer Confuse You with Bread?

Refined wheat flour is masked by terms on the label such as "100% wheat," "unbleached wheat flour," "multigrain," and "organic flour," to name a few.

### Brown Bread

This is often confused with whole wheat bread. It has very little whole wheat flour, about 20%, while 80% will be maida or refined flour again. The brown color is mainly because of the presence of caramel color that has been added to make it look attractive and healthy. In fact, it has slightly more carbohydrates than white bread. So read labels to differentiate between whole wheat and brown bread.

### Whole Wheat Bread

Whole wheat bread should be made of 100% whole wheat. Most brands in India contain only 40-80% whole wheat, and the remaining is refined wheat or maida. Manufacturers mislead us by using "whole wheat bread" as the label but add more refined flour.

**"The label should say 100% whole wheat flour and nothing less."**

Do not get misled by terms such as "enriched wheat flour" and "wheat flour," which are just terms for refined flour.

Enriched bread has synthetic vitamins added to improve nutritional quality, but these are not natural and will not be absorbed optimally.

### Multi-grain Bread

Multi-grain bread is prepared by adding multiple grains such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, buckwheat, and millets such as ragi, bajra, etc. Some may even include soybean flour. Multi-grain bread has more fiber content, lower glycemic index, higher protein content, and more vitamins and minerals compared to whole wheat bread.

Although healthy, if consumed in high quantities, it may affect gut health and cause bloating and indigestion, and this type of bread may not be suitable for all. It may also contain anti-nutrients which may prevent the absorption of various minerals such as iron, calcium, and zinc.

Nuts and seeds added in multi-grain breads are baked at high temperatures that can alter the structure of fats and reduce the availability of nutrients.

If you want to select multi-grain bread, watch out for terms such as "made with whole grains," as sometimes all the grains may not be "whole" and may include refined grains. Whole grain does not include bran, wheat germ, and enriched flour.

### Stone Ground Wheat Bread

Stone grinding is a traditional processing method of wheat grains which involves crushing the whole grain to make whole wheat flour. But do read the labels clearly to check if you are getting only whole grains.

## Preservatives in Bread

Earlier, bread was freshly baked daily at home or by local bakers and was consumed within a day or two. But now, as we have moved on to industrial production of bread, it is not possible to sell fresh bread daily.

To improve the keeping quality of bread, most brands are adding a lot of unhealthy fats and preservatives.

## Harmful Ingredients Found in Bread

### Partially Hydrogenated Fats

[Partially hydrogenated fats](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hydrogentated-oil#uses) such as [palm oil](https://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/palm-oil/) have replaced butter as they help prevent spoilage and reduce production costs. These fats have been linked to increased bad cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. The ["zero trans fats"](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114) labeled bread is actually made from hydrogenated fats. The cheap hydrogenated fats go rancid, and to overcome this, bread is loaded with preservatives.

### Bleaching Agents

Bleaching agents are used to lighten or whiten the bread, break down the wheat protein, and help in faster maturation of flour.

**Potassium bromate**, a bleaching agent and a dough raising agent, has been linked to cancer and has been banned in many countries. It is a carcinogen, and the WHO lists it under ingredients that cause cancer. [FSSAI in India has banned the use of potassium bromate in bread since 2018 and other baking products](https://www.fssai.gov.in/upload/media/5a9e6ec79cd7eFSSAI_News_Potassium_FNB_21_02_2018.pdf), but it is still found in many bread products.

**Azodicarbonamide (ADA)**, which improves dough strength, has been proven to cause cancer, allergies, and asthma in experiments conducted on lab mice. This chemical is also found in synthetic leather in shoes and rubber mats. It is considered as safe [(GRAS)](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-ingredients-packaging/generally-recognized-safe-gras) by the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) in prescribed amounts, while it is banned in Australia, UK, and other European countries. In India, only [Subway claims not to use ADA in their breads](https://www.firstpost.com/business/corporate-business/phew-subway-confirms-no-shoe-rubber-chemical-used-in-indian-breads-1958737.html).

**Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)**, another preservative, has been linked to cancer. Although FSSAI has set limits for its use.

**Alloxan** can induce diabetes and heart disease. It has been banned by [FSSAI](https://www.fssai.gov.in/), but it can be formed as a by-product during the process of bleaching with carbon dioxide.

There are many other bleaching agents for whitening bread, such as alloxan, hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, calcium peroxide, sulfur dioxide, and chlorine dioxide.

### High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)

[HFCS](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-high-fructose-corn-syrup) is added as a sweetener and as a browning agent and is cheaper than granulated or table sugar. It can add a lot of empty calories and is potentially harmful to your liver, blood sugars, triglyceride levels, and heart.

### Caramel Coloring

This coloring added to brown and multi-grain breads is said to be [carcinogenic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/25081-carcinogens), and it is similar to the color added in soft drinks.

### Soybean Additives

Genetically modified soybean oil and soy lecithin are dough softeners, and the use of [genetically modified foods](https://www.webmd.com/diet/genetically-modified-foods-overview) is still a questionable practice.

### Thickeners

Xanthan gum and guar gum are potentially harmless but can cause digestive issues and trigger Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

There is ongoing research to develop and use natural preservatives such as plant essential oils, [lactic acid bacteria (LAB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_bacteria), nanoparticles, and better packaging materials so that we can naturally preserve bread without any chemical preservatives.

## How Eating Bread Can Affect You

### Bread and Weight

Bread has been marketed as a weight loss food. But you should understand that calories in all types of bread remain the same, while the only difference is that whole grain and multi-grain breads may be nutritionally better than white and brown bread. In fact, the calories increase if the amount of added sugar, fats, and seed toppings are high. Hence, bread should not be marketed as a weight loss product.

### Bread and Diabetes

Bread is a high GI food, but the GI will depend on the fiber content. The higher the fiber content, the lower the GI value. But bread is high in carbohydrates and therefore should not be consumed alone as it can increase blood sugar levels in a diabetic patient. If a diabetic would need to include bread in their diet, adding vegetables, unprocessed cheese, paneer, sprouts, green peas, eggs, or chicken can reduce the GI value and lower the spikes in sugar levels. So diabetics should be cautious while adding bread to their diet.

### Bread and Heart Disease

Usually, a bread sandwich is marketed as a healthy snack. Watch out for trans fats and preservatives such as alloxan in bread, which are known to cause heart disease, and choose bread that is low in fat to prevent it. Sandwiches made with mayonnaise and processed meats such as ham and bacon are high in saturated fats and can cause heart disease. Refined flour has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

### Bread and Osteoarthritis

Bread made of refined flour has been known to cause inflammation and trigger arthritis pain, while whole wheat breads are said to be beneficial in preventing [osteoarthritis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5599-osteoarthritis).

### Bread and Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Bread is made from fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols [(FODMAP)](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/fodmap-diet-what-you-need-to-know), which are types of carbohydrates. The added preservatives in bread can aggravate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome such as bloating, stomach cramps, constipation, and diarrhea.

### Bread and Gluten

As wheat contains the protein [gluten](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/what-is-gluten-and-what-does-it-do#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGluten%20is%20a%20protein%20found,together%20and%20give%20them%20shape.), it is unsuitable for people who have [gluten sensitivity or allergy](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/non-celiac-gluten-sensitivity/). Those who have gluten sensitivity should avoid all types of bread made of wheat, rye, and barley, and opt for millet bread such as ragi (finger millet), sorghum (jowar), or pearl millet (bajra) bread.

### Bread and Cancer

Consuming bread is not directly linked to cancer, but the additives and preservatives used may be carcinogenic. Use of whole grain bread has been linked to lower cancer rates.

## How to Select the Right Bread

- Look for basic ingredients such as whole wheat flour, yeast, fat, sugar, and salt, where fat and sugar should be mentioned toward the end of the ingredients list.
- Bread should be consumable within 2 days of manufacture when kept at room temperature, and if it shows signs of early spoilage, it is a positive indicator that the bread is free of preservatives. The longer the bread takes to spoil, the higher the added preservatives.
- Read labels very carefully.
- You can enjoy bread in moderation but focus on pairing it with plenty of vegetables and proteins.
- Avoid additives and preservatives in bread.
- Bake your own bread!
